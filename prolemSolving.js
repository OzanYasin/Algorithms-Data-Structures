// -------- Problem Solving --------

// Objectives:

// - Define what an algorithm is
// - Devise (planning) a plan to solve algorithms
// - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

// What is an Algorithm?

// A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
// Almost everything that you do in programming inlolves some kind of algorithm.
// It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer
// Also... INTERVIEWS, INTERVIEWS, and INTERVIEWS!

// How do you Improve?

// 1- Devise (design) a plan for solving problems
// 2- Master common problem solving patterns.

// ------- First Section: Problem Solving Strategies -------

// A simple, foolproof, magical, miraculous, fail-safe approach! (*NOT REALLY)

// * Understand the Problem
// * Explore Concrete (somut) Examples
// * Break It Down
